Pi-Top Battery Information

Fire hazard?
------------

[WARNING]
====
If a Li-ion battery overheats, hisses or bulges, immediately move the
device away from flammable materials and place it on a non-combustible
surface.
If at all possible, remove the battery and put it outdoors to burn out.

A small Li-ion fire can be handled like any other combustible fire.
For best result use a foam extinguisher, CO2, ABC dry chemical, powdered
graphite, copper powder or soda (sodium carbonate).
If the fire occurs in an airplane cabin, the FAA instructs flight
attendants to use water or soda pop.
Water-based products are most readily available and are appropriate
since Li-ion contains very little lithium metal that reacts with water.
Water also cools the adjacent area and prevents the fire from spreading.
Research laboratories and factories also use water to extinguish Li-ion
battery fires.
Halon is also used as fire suppressant, but this agent may not be
sufficient to extinguish a large Li-ion fire in the cargo bay of an
aircraft.

A large Li-ion fire, such as in an EV, may need to burn out as water
is ineffective.
Water with copper material can be used, but this may not be available
and is costly for fire halls.

When encountering a fire with a lithium-metal battery, only use a Class
D fire extinguisher.
**Lithium-metal contains plenty of lithium that reacts with water and
makes the fire worse.**
As the number of EVs grows, so must the methods to extinguish such fires.

There is a manufacturer access program created by @rricharz, but he has
asked me not to spread it around due to the risk of fire.
If you need it, ask him.
The program is called `m_access`.

Basic Information
-----------------

Hardware information is from @rricharz.
The guy's definitely a wizard.

 - The battery is a `bq40z60`.
 - The slave address is `0x0b`.
 - If any cell drops below 2.5V, the whole thing fails permanently.
 - If the hub controller is not shut down _properly_, it will keep
   draining the battery even when everything else is off.
 - Check link:https://github.com/rricharz/pi-top-battery-status/blob/master/battery_problems.md[this page]
   if you have problems.
